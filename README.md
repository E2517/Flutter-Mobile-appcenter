# Build and release an Android app in appcenter

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android)
- [appcenter](https://buildflutter.com/deploying-flutter-apps-via-appcenter/)

1- Signing the app

* Go to java/jdk/bin and inside execute this code changing USER_NAME for your user

./keytool -genkey -v -keystore c:\Users\USER_NAME\key.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key

* Go to your flutter project <app dir>/android/app/build.gradle and apply the changes that [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android)

2- Building the app for release (two options).

* flutter build appbundle (recommended however not supported for some stores)
* flutter build apk --split-per-abi 

This command results in three APK files:

* <app dir>/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
* <app dir>/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
* <app dir>/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-x86_64-release.apk
  
Removing the --split-per-abi flag results in a fat APK that contains your code compiled for all the target ABIs. Such APKs are larger in size than their split counterparts, causing the user to download native binaries that are not applicable to their deviceâ€™s architecture.

This projects is about building the flutter app directly in appcenter.

2- Generate the apk with flutter build apk --split-per-abi after signing the app and release it in appcenter (simple)
